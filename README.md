| [What is Data Science @ O'reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science) | _Data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution. They are inherently interdiscplinary. They can tackle all aspects of a problem, from initial data collection and data conditioning to drawing conclusions. They can think outside the box to come up with new ways to view the problem, or to work with very broadly defined problems: “here’s a lot of data, what can you make from it?”_ |
| [What is Data Science @ Quora](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) | Data Science is a combination of a number of aspects of Data such as Technology, Algorithm development, and data interference to study the data, analyse it, and find innovative solutions to difficult problems. Basically Data Science is all about Analysing data and driving for business growth by finding creative ways. |
| [How to Become a Data Scientist](https://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-scientist/) | _Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations._ |
